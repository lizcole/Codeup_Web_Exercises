		<h2>This is a story about 3 hamsters</h3>
			
			<p>I have owned 3 hamsteres in my life. One died because it was eaten by my grandparent's dauchshund. <br>
			When my Grandpa saw the hamster in Dixie's mouth(the dauchshund) he said, <br>
			
				<blockquote>"Is that a beanie baby?....THAT'S NO DAMN BEANIE BABY!! That's a hamster!"</blockquote> 
			
			The second one I sold in a garage sale because I didn't want to take care of it.<br>
			The third one was mean and would bite anybody who held it, so we kept it in the garage.<br>
			He chewed through his plastic cage and escaped into the woods behind our house.<br>
			<em>Nobody missed him.</em></p>
			
			<p>The End.<br></p>
